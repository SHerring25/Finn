		<h1>Learning CSS</h1>
		<h4>Hello, my name is Saed Herring. This is my first CSS assignment practice. This is a bit of a refresher for me, so I have some 
		experience with HTML/CSS coding. It's always good to learn basics, because it can help you solve challenges that may occur when working on a project.</h4>

		<p>One of my favorite anime shows is Rurouni Kenshin. He is a very skilled swordsman, who posses a unique sword. His sword is a reverse blade sword; meaning it is not meant to be used to kill, but if it comes down to a life and death battle then Kenshin simply reverses the blade around for a kill strike. I really enjoy the action and suspense in the show
		and also the comedy they have in some parts. This is one of the shows I would request someone to watch, if they want to get into anime.</p>
